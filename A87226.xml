         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119033:3"/>preached, <hi>Act. 18.</hi> one while he demands, if there was a con≈øtituted original Church with Officers in it at this time, when <hi>Apollos</hi> preached,<note place="margin">See his book <hi>page 22, 23.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Act. 18.</hi> and by and by he ≈øaith, That <hi>it is certain,</hi> Apollos <hi>was at this time an Officer;</hi> and bids me prove, that he was ever made an Officer after his preaching, <hi>Act. 18.</hi> Again, he ≈øaith, <hi>If the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was a true Church, then her Mini≈øters were true Mini≈øters, when our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were ordained by her.</hi> And demands, why I did not di≈øprove her to be a Church, <hi>pag. 41.</hi> and yet a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ≈øaith, That <hi>≈øhe was as bad when the Mini≈øters did receive Ordination from her, as ≈øhe was when they left her;</hi> and yet he ≈øaith, <hi>They left her not as ≈øhe was the Spou≈øe of Chri≈øt, but as ≈øhe was a Harlot,</hi> page <hi>39.</hi> ≈øo that he ≈øuppo≈øeth <hi>Rome</hi> to be a Harlot, and Chri≈øt's Spou≈øe at one and the ≈øame time. Again, he ≈øaith, <hi>page 37.</hi> That <hi>the corruptions of the corrupt Di≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øers of Ordinances cannot make them null;</hi> and yet he ≈øaith, <hi>pag. 48. If it be true as Mr.</hi> Brookes <hi>≈øaith,</hi> That the Mini≈øters of <hi>England</hi> are Antichri≈øtian; <hi>then all that they have baptized, mu≈øt be baptized again.</hi> Is not this plain contradiction?</p>
            <p>As he abounds with Contradictions, ≈øo he doth with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, medling with the Trade that I follow, and my being a Souldier, and ≈øuch-like things, that concern not the Que≈øtion before him. Another while he blames me for that he doth him≈øelf, <hi>viz.</hi> of meddling with this Controver≈øie, and taking it out of Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> his hand; when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to an≈øwer a particular Paper, which was proper for none el≈øe to an≈øwer but Mr. <hi>Willes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another while he blames me for that I did charge a thing upon Mr. <hi>Willes,</hi> that I had but one witne≈øs for; and
<pb facs="tcp:119033:3"/>yet him≈øelf believes the Accu≈øed's bare Negation without any witne≈øs: for at that time when Mr. <hi>VVilles</hi> de≈øired a Gentleman to apprehend me for a Je≈øuite, there was none pre≈øent to witne≈øs be≈øides the Gentleman afore≈øaid, though at our fir≈øt meeting there was divers.</p>
            <p>Again, one while he ≈øaith, <hi>Rome had power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Mini≈øters as Chri≈øt's Church;</hi> and by and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them to Thieves, and to <hi>Korah,</hi> at the time they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the fir≈øt Reformers.</p>
            <p>Again, his Book is full of unman-like arguings, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his frequent begging the chief things in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion; otherwhile, when I demand a proof of tho≈øe things that are ≈øo frequently affirmed by Mr. <hi>VVilles,</hi> he demands how I prove they are not; and ≈øo turns the proof of the affirmation from him≈øelf, and puts his Re≈øpondent to prove Negations. Surely, this is not to give a Rea≈øon of our Hope to every one that asketh, with Meekne≈øs and Fear.</p>
            <p>Again, he tells his Reader, That <hi>the Anabapti≈øts are bloody,</hi> pag. <hi>31.</hi> and <hi>pag. 50.</hi> he ≈øaith, he ghe≈ø≈øes, that <hi>they are the men who≈øe hands were mo≈øt embrued in the blood of the late VVars:</hi> When indeed, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bapti≈øts were in no capacity at the beginning of the≈øe Wars, to blow tho≈øe ≈øparks of contention into a burning Flame, if they had had a minde to ≈øo bad a work.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given thee a ta≈øte of that Spirit that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired him in the writing of his Book, to which I have given an An≈øwer; and though I have not an≈øwered to every word, yet I have an≈øwered every thing that hath any ≈øhew or colour of Rea≈øon in it, which I de≈øire thee

            <p>You proceed to an Epi≈øtle, where you tell your Reader, That <hi>if he be a Friend to Truth, he probably hath ere this been grieved to ≈øee the ho≈øt of I≈ørael routed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Mini≈øtery SO MUCH ≈øhattered,</hi> &amp;c. why then do you glory and cry <hi>victoria,</hi> if the Clergy, which you call <hi>the Ho≈øt of</hi> I≈ørael, be routed? ≈øhould not you mourn, as well as you would have your Reader? but in ≈øtead thereof, you blame your Enemy for glorying, as though he had no occa≈øion; and wear the Lawrel your ≈øelf, wreathing it upon your own brows, as though you had ≈øo routed your Enemy, that he would never rally: what need is there for the Reader to grieve, if Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> hath routed and ≈øhattered the choice≈øt Ranks of his Enemies? (unle≈øs you flatter Mr. <hi>Willes,</hi> and deal truely with your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) for is not this ≈øtrange, that you tell your Reader,<note place="margin">See his Epi≈øtle to Mr. <hi>Willes.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>the Lords Ho≈øt is routed;</hi> and yet flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Mr. <hi>Willes,</hi> and tell him, <hi>the Enemy is routed?</hi> And by this you may ≈øee, that you are ≈øo unfit to be an Armour-Bearer in this Warfare, that you ju≈øtly de≈øerve to be cha≈øhiered the Camp for your fal≈øe Intelligence. For you tell Mr. <hi>Willes,</hi> the Enemy is ≈øhattered; and yet tell your Reader the Mini≈øtery are ≈øhattered. But is the Clergy ≈øhattered? no marvel then that the people are ≈øhattered: for, <hi>like Prie≈øt, like People:</hi> a ≈øhattered Clergy mu≈øt not look
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119033:5"/>for any thing, but a di≈øcompo≈øed people. And truely, that is the greate≈øt Truth in your Packet: for how few of them agree in any thing ≈øave in the point of Tythes, common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can te≈øtifie, if you had ≈øaid nothing.</p>
            <p>You go on ≈øtill in your Epi≈øtle, and tell your Reader, That <hi>if he be ≈øhaken, you have ≈øent him ≈øome Counter-Queries, and bid him judge, and try; and then</hi> (you ≈øay) <hi>you hope he will blu≈øh at his uncon≈øtancy,</hi> &amp;c. So he may well, if what you have writ ≈øhould ≈øhake his under≈øtanding, then he mu≈øt needs be one that is carried about with every Airy notion.</p>
            <p>You further tell your Reader, That <hi>if he be an enemy to truth, he hath triumphed before the victory,</hi> &amp;c. How can that be? when you exhort to grieve, becau≈øe them that you call <hi>the Enemy,</hi> have routed the Ho≈øt: what is that le≈øs then Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, if you ≈øpeak Truth?</p>
            <p>You go on, and tell your Reader, That <hi>if Mr.</hi> Brookes <hi>or his Church, invited me to be the Patron of their cau≈øe, you might gue≈øs them to be mi≈øerably baffled,</hi> &amp;c. Fir≈øt, neither Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> nor his Church ever invited me to do them this ≈øervice; but if they had, if their inviting me to be a Patron to the cau≈øe, had argued them to be mi≈øerably baffled; how mi≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably baffled did you fear your ≈øelf ≈øhould be in what you had writ, when you begged Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> to be your Patron?</p>
            <p>You tell your Reader, That <hi>he cannot expect Mr.</hi> Willes <hi>≈øhould hinder his more ≈øerious di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of this weighty point, to take notice of my ≈ølight Queries.</hi> This, I confe≈øs, is an ea≈øie way to confute the ≈øtronge≈øt Arguments, for a man that is contrary minded, to call them <hi>≈ølight;</hi> and ≈øay, he is not at lea≈øure to an≈øwer them. If I had an≈øwered you thus, ≈øurely men would have judged, you had more ≈øtrength on your ≈øide, then you have.</p>
            <p>You go on, and bid your Reader ≈øee, if here be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to puzzle me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You are now guilty of that which you blamed your Adver≈øary for, but now, <hi>viz.</hi> of triumphing before the Victory: but it ≈øeems then, the end of your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was to <hi>puzzle,</hi> and not to <hi>convince</hi> your Adver≈øary.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:119033:6"/>
            <p>I proceed now to take notice of your Epi≈øtle to Mr. <hi>Willes,</hi> in which you tell him, <hi>my grounds are ≈ølight,</hi> &amp;c. This tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing of yours, is but like that which <hi>Job</hi> ≈øpeaks of, that <hi>is but for a moment,</hi> Job 20.5.</p>
            <p>You demand of Mr. <hi>Willes,</hi> in what ≈øence he a≈ø≈øerted the baptizing the Children of wicked Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you pre≈øume he means onely ≈øuch as are Church-Members, and are not ca≈øt out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Truely, either your Church are all good, or el≈øe you are partakers of their ≈øins in not ca≈øting them out: for I have not heard of one vile per≈øon, that the Presbyters have excluded.</p>
            <p>There is another Que≈øtion which you propound to Mr. <hi>Willes,</hi> viz <hi>What were his own words concerning the Fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-men.</hi> About Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> a≈ø≈øerting tho≈øe words touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fifth-Monarchy-men, I have not wronged him, as hereafter ≈øhall appear.</p>
            <p>You further ask Mr. <hi>Willes, Whether he did po≈øitively a≈ø≈øert me to be a Je≈øuite,</hi> &amp;c. Surely, you did not think Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> had ≈øo much to do as you made your Reader believe even now, that you ask him ≈øo needle≈øs a Que≈øtion: for did I ≈øay or intimate that Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> did po≈øitively a≈ø≈øert me to be a Je≈øuite? why did you not ask him whether I had two hands or three? it had been as much to your purpo≈øe. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>You tell him, That <hi>if any thing appear in print in an≈øwer to the whole, it will beg his patronage of its cau≈øe,</hi> &amp;c. If he did not father it, it would be an Orphan, ≈øince the true Father will not be known. But doth not your Logick teach me to believe you feared to be mi≈øerably baffled, ≈øince you thus beg for his Patronage? Surely, you thought your Wine to be mix'd with Water, that you beg Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his Bu≈øh to hang at your Door, that ≈øo it might ≈øell the better, and not be que≈øtioned.</p>
            <p>The next thing that followeth in your Book is Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his Letter, wherein he tells you, That <hi>the people were ≈øo rude
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119033:6"/>that it might have proved to my peril, if he had not pacified them,</hi> &amp;c. This ≈øhews what Spirit your Churches are filled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that it is perillous for a man to ask a Que≈øtion among them, though never ≈øo ≈øoberly: for no man in his wits will believe that they were of Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> his Church that were ≈øo much my Enemies, ≈øeeing (you ≈øay) I came to be a Patron to their cau≈øe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> tells you further, That <hi>he laid down two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as the grounds of my ≈øatisfaction:</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That Mini≈øters in an ordinary way were to be ordained by Mini≈øters.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity, where there was no Mini≈øters to ordain, fit Per≈øons might become Mini≈øters without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But he doth not tell you, that I asked him by which of the≈øe ways he came into the Mini≈øtery; and he would not tell me, though I pre≈øt him once and again: for though I grant the≈øe two ways of Admi≈ø≈øion, yet I denied that ever he came in by either. Hereupon he told me, <hi>If there was but two ways of coming into a Hou≈øe, and if he were in, I mu≈øt conclude that he came in at one of them.</hi> But is not this a ≈øhameful begging the Que≈øtion? for though I granted the≈øe two were to be the ways of entrance, yet I denied him to be come in by either. Now what is it but to beg the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion, when he ≈øhall take it for granted he is in by one of the afore≈øaid ways, when I denied him to be in by either? as him≈øelf confe≈ø≈øeth in his Letter to you, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. later end: for he ≈øaith, <hi>I oppo≈øed both;</hi> meaning both his entrance by a lawful Ordination, or by nece≈ø≈øity. So then, this is your Champion's Argument, which is like <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword in his hand, the Propo≈øition being, That <hi>he is no Mini≈øter of Chri≈øt, either by a lawful Ordination, or by any pretended nece≈ø≈øity:</hi> So that his great Argument (if I may put it in form) is:</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:119033:7"/>
            <q>
               <l>If I am a Mini≈øter by one of the≈øe ways, then I am a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter by one of them:</l>
               <l>But I am a Mini≈øter by one of them;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> I am a Mini≈øter by one of them.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Nothing el≈øe can be made of this that he propounds. Now this had been a dilemma indeed, if I had granted him to be a true Mini≈øter, and had confe≈ø≈øed that a man cannot be a true Mini≈øter but by one of the ways afore≈øaid; then he had rea≈øoned like a man, if he had ≈øaid, Since I grant him to be a Mini≈øter, and withal grant, that none can enter but by the ways afore≈øaid, then he mu≈øt needs come in by one of them. But ≈øince I denied both, how wildly doth he rea≈øon?</p>
            <p>Again, doth not Chri≈øt ≈øay, That <hi>he that comes not in at the door, is a thief and a robber?</hi> Now though I granted that there was no other lawful way of coming into the Office, yet a mans being in, doth not prove he came in any of the≈øe lawful ways; becau≈øe Chri≈øt ≈øuppo≈øeth they may get in by climing up another way.</p>
            <p>The next thing Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> takes notice of in his An≈øwer to your Letter, is that which he ≈øpake about the baptizing the Children of wicked Parents, which he ≈øaith <hi>are ≈øuch Children, who≈øe Parents are not juridically ejected by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His Reformation, as I have told, is ≈øo good, that none de≈øerves Excommunication; or el≈øe ≈øo bad, that he doth not execute that Ordinance upon them; or if he do, then all that he doth excommunicate are childle≈øs; or el≈øe he, contrarily to his Principles, baptizeth their Children; for he refu≈øeth to baptize none. But if his Argument be good, That <hi>the Children of wicked Parents are to be baptized, becau≈øe ≈øometimes God chu≈øeth them that are wicked Mens Children,</hi> Doth not this Argument plead as much for the Children of tho≈øe that are excommunicated? may not God chu≈øe the Children of ≈øuch as well the Children of others? and doth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119033:7"/>not the Children of wicked excommunicated Parents, ≈øtand in need of an Obligation to Holine≈øs, as well as the Children of tho≈øe wicked Parents that are not excommunicated? and yet this man ≈øaith, That <hi>wicked mens Children, the wor≈øe their Parents are, the more need their Children have of Bapti≈øm:</hi> and yet he denies it to the children of tho≈øe who are excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated. It ≈øeems then, you judge them you keep in the Church wor≈øe then they you ca≈øt out, or el≈øe this cannot be a true Maxime, <hi>viz. The wor≈øe the Parents are, the more need the Children have of Bapti≈øm:</hi> for if they you ca≈øt out are the wor≈øt, then it follows, that their Children have the more need, by his Argument: if ≈øo, why doth he confine it to none but ≈øuch as are within the Church?</p>
            <p>Whoever de≈øires further ≈øatisfaction in this point, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the baptizing of Infants. I ≈øhall refer them to my Book, entituled, <hi>Infants Bapti≈øm di≈øproved;</hi> by which you will ≈øee Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his fal≈øe A≈øper≈øion wiped away, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>I ≈øought to colour my Opinion, which was again≈øt the Baptizing of any infants.</hi> For not onely my Book te≈øtifies my willingne≈øs to own my Opinion publickly, but I did tell Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> to his Face, that I would prove it unlawful to baptize any Infant; as many can witne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> in his Letter further tells you, That <hi>he did decry the Fifth-Monarchy-men among other Sects that cry down their Mini≈øtery, as the ≈ømoak of the bottomle≈øs pit, ≈ømelling ≈øtrong of the Brim≈øtone of Hell:</hi> his proof for this is ≈øo faint, that he ≈øu≈øpects it him≈øelf; for he ≈øaith, <hi>he alluded in that ≈øpeech to</hi> Rev. 9.2, 3. <hi>by which text</hi> (he ≈øaith) <hi>≈øuch Sects are meant, AS SOME DO INTERPRET.</hi> Is not this a brave ≈øtroke? do you reckon this one of his fatal blows he hath given the Adver≈øary, by telling them their Breath is as the ≈ømoak of the bottomle≈øs Pit? but it is but AS SOME DO INTERPRET.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:119033:8"/>
            <q>
               <l>Miraris Wil≈øum rixis impl√™≈ø≈øe theatrum?</l>
               <l>Ingenio Portae convenit ille ≈øuae.</l>
               <l>No marvel Willes pulpit fills with railing and debate,</l>

            </q>
            <p>The la≈øt thing of moment that Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> mentions in his Letter, is, That <hi>he never affirmed upon any information that I was a Je≈øuite;</hi> and that <hi>he did never in≈øtigate any to apprehend mt.</hi> For proof of this, I ≈øhall refer you to this Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Vancourt</hi> for a Witne≈øs, who is ready to make Oath of the truth thereof; by which Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his untruths appear, together with his malice, though he cries out of the malice of others.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman is a man known for Piety, and to bear a good e≈øteem in the National Mini≈øtery; and al≈øo he is of good Credit in the World: and therefore know, that it was more ju≈øt for me to believe his Affirmation, then for you to take the Accu≈øed's bare Negation. Therefore I judge, my life would lie at ≈øtake, if Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> had as good proof to prove me a Je≈øuite, as I have to prove that he did adverti≈øe this Gentleman to apprehend me for a Je≈øuite.</p>
            <p>This ≈øhall ≈øuffice to this Letter, and to your ob≈øervation thereon in the later end of your Book.</p>
            <p>I come now to your Epi≈øtle Dedicatory, wherein you do excu≈øe your flattering of Mr. <hi>Willes:</hi> but what do you el≈øe, when you tell him you pre≈øume to be his Armor-Bearer? and in a Complement tell him, That <hi>you were a ≈øpectator of tho≈øe furious ≈øtrokes, whereby he ≈øhattered the choi≈øe≈øt Ranks of his Enemies, and dealt about ≈øuch fatal blows, that their choi≈øe≈øt Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions fell before him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Why did you not tell your Reader, if you do not flatter, where tho≈øe blows were given, and tho≈øe battels fought? and when it was that this Victory was obtained, that you ≈øo much glory in? and what the Names of tho≈øe choice
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119033:8"/>Champions were, that fell by his fatal blows? Methinks, if you were a Spectator (as you ≈øay you were) of the≈øe great Conflicts, you can re≈øolve the≈øe Que≈øtions, that ≈øo you may comfort your grieving Reader, who yet doth believe your fir≈øt words that you told him, <hi>viz.</hi> That your Army was routed, which you called <hi>the ho≈øt of</hi> I≈ørael.</p>
            <p>Your pre≈øuming to bear Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his Armor, ≈øhews how little you have of the Armor of God in this Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; and your fighting under his Shield, ≈øhews how little you have of the Shield of Faith: but do you take Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his Armor, and fight under his Shield, becau≈øe you ≈øo much de≈øire it; and I will take the Armor of God, and the Shield of Faith, to fight again≈øt you, and ≈øhall leave the ≈øucce≈øs of the Victory to God: and though you boa≈øt upon the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of your Armor, as though you were ≈øo dreadful, that your Enemy would flee when he heard of you, (for by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing your Name, you thought I ≈øhould never ≈øee you) yet know, that it had been better and more mode≈øt for you to have gloried when you had put your Armor off. But I am not fled yet; and if I do flee, I may be ea≈øier found upon the flight, becau≈øe my Name is known, then you can be who conceal your Name and Place of abode, for no other rea≈øon that I know of, but for fear le≈øt you ≈øhould be apprehended in your flight.</p>
            <p>You now face about, and direct your ≈øpeech to me; and tell me, That <hi>you hope your ra≈øhne≈øs is not ≈øo great, as</hi> Eliabs <hi>was to</hi> David, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.18, 28. <hi>if you ≈øay, that it is my bu≈øine≈øs to carry Loaves and Chee≈øe to the Camp, out of the pride and naughtine≈øs of my Heart, that I above all others ≈øhould ≈øingle out a Champion to encounter with,</hi> &amp;c. If your ra≈øhne≈øs be not ≈øo great as <hi>Eliabs</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> it ≈øeems it is ra≈øhne≈øs, though not ≈øo great; as not onely your words do intimate, but the ≈øtory you allude to, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.18, 28. by which your Reader may ≈øee you compare your ≈øelf to <hi>Eliab,</hi> and me to <hi>David,</hi> who carried Loaves and Chee≈øe to the Army; and the Army that you called <hi>the Ho≈øt of</hi> I≈ørael, you now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

            <p>You proceed and tell me, That <hi>either I uncivilly took Mr.</hi> Brookes <hi>his work out of his hand, or el≈øe that I highly valued my ≈øelf as one that could manage it better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, was not all the audience concerned as well as Mr. <hi>Brookes,</hi> in what Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> delivered? ≈øince he told them how dangerous it was to hear men that were not ordained.</p>
            <p>Secondly, did not Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> confe≈øs, that he invited all that had Objections, to give them in either in word or in writing?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, doth not Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> think ≈øo of men? if he doth not, why ≈øhould you? ≈øeeing, if I have dealt uncivilly, he is the per≈øon offended.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, is not the work ≈øtill in Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> his hands, for all that I have ≈øaid or done?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, is it not greater incivility for you to take upon you to an≈øwer a particular paper, which was particulary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Mr. <hi>Willes?</hi> This ≈øurely ≈øavours more of arrogancy then any thing that I have done.</p>
            <p>You go on, and ask five Que≈øtions, and an≈øwer them your ≈øelf; by which it appears, you can an≈øwer Que≈øtions of your own making, ea≈øier then you can tho≈øe that are made by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

However, you grant that there was <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pri≈øcilla,</hi> and tho≈øe Chri≈øtians that <hi>Paul</hi> brought with him which he preached to, which were enough to make a Chri≈øtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as vain as you ≈øeem to make the con≈øequence.

            <p>I an≈øwer, Fir≈øt, where do you read of a Chri≈øtian-Church not con≈øtituted?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Do you not ≈øay, That <hi>Apollos</hi> was an Officer? what then did hinder them from being a con≈øtituted Church? The Scriptures ≈øay, <hi>Chri≈øts Church is his Body:</hi> and I never read of a Body con≈øtituted, and another uncon≈øtituted. And for your ≈øaying, <hi>Apollos was in Office,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5. doth this prove he was then in Office? <hi>Act</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>You go on, and ask me all the≈øe negative Que≈øtions, <hi>viz. How I prove he was not in Office? and how I prove he was no Prie≈øt, and that</hi> John <hi>did not anthorize him? and ought I not to prove that he was not in Office thus? and ought I not to prove there

            <p>To which I an≈øwer, That you are an excellent Armour-Bearer: Is this your Armour of proof? when a man demands of you how you prove that ≈øuch a thing was, you an≈øwer by asking your Re≈øpondent how he proves it was not. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you have more need go to School then write Books. But let's hear what you ≈øay for the Affirmative ≈øince you ≈øay, <hi>page</hi> 23. That <hi>it is certain he was in Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your fir≈øt Rea≈øon is, <hi>He watered the Churches that</hi> Paul <hi>had planted,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.6. 1 Cor. 16.12.</p>
            <p>Let's try this Argument, and put it into a form, and then it will be thus: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apollos</hi> did the work of an Evangeli≈øt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is certain he was in Office at the time <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pri≈øcilla</hi> taught him, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>May not a man as well rea≈øon thus:</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> preaches at <hi>Botolphs Billings-gate</hi> as an Officer, (if you will believe it:)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is certain he was an Officer when he was in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into Religion.</p>
            <p>You go on, and ask me, <hi>If</hi> Apollo<hi>'s worth and name was not the head of a Faction,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.12.</p>
            <p>This is your ≈øecond Argument to prove that certainly he was in Office.</p>
            <p>Is this a good Argument, <hi>Apollos</hi> was the Head of a Faction for his worth and name: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was an Officer in the Church? will not this prove Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> to be an Officer when future times ≈øhall read the Hi≈øtory of his Life; ≈øeeing that he preaches Chri≈øt, and is e≈øteemed for his worth and name, and (as your ≈øelves ≈øay) he is the Head of a Faction? how dare you deny Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> to be an Officer, if this be good Logick?</p>
            <p>Your third Rea≈øon is, <hi>He is called</hi> (you ≈øay) <hi>in expre≈øs terms</hi> a Mini≈øter, <hi>in the ≈øen≈øe</hi> that Paul <hi>was,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5. <hi>He was an Officer</hi> (you ≈øay) <hi>then ≈øure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have an≈øwered this already, by ≈øhewing, that though
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119033:13"/>he might be an Officer then, yet he was not in Office, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. and you mu≈øt prove, and not beg.</p>
            <p>You go on, and bid me prove <hi>that</hi> Apollos <hi>was ordained after he preached</hi> Act. 18.</p>
            <p>What if I cannot? doth this prove he was ordained at that time? do not you prove it for me, when you ≈øuppo≈øe in the later end of <hi>page</hi> 20. That he might preach by nece≈ø≈øity; and that there was no Organical con≈øtituted Church at this time, and Officers to preach in it? and do you not ask me, Whether the Apo≈øtolical In≈øtitution was practiced at that time? or, Whether <hi>Apollos</hi> knew of ≈øuch a thing as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to be had from the Apo≈øtles?

            <p>And for your citing the <hi>London</hi>-Mini≈øters, are not they like to be good Witne≈ø≈øes, ≈øeeing they are parties that would fain make all Antiquity ≈øpeak for the things they profe≈øs, that the novelty of them may not be ≈øu≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted?</p>

This was the ≈øum of this Que≈øtion.

            <p>But wherein do I ≈øpeak any thing unlike a Chri≈øtian? if that be true as you ≈øay, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Epi≈øcopal Ordination was good, and that they did practice it in the purity of it, without ≈øuper≈øtitious mixture,</hi> as you confe≈øs in your ≈øeventeenth

            <p>And for your ≈øaying, That <hi>the Anabapti≈øtical Spirits are bloody, witne≈øs tho≈øe in</hi> Germany, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, This is an unchri≈øtian Charge indeed, and therefore you thought you would cry out fir≈øt, That others were guilty, that your ≈øelf might not be ≈øu≈øpected: for, what if that ≈øtory of <hi>Germany</hi> were true, (which is doubtful in many things) doth not this ≈øhew what Spirit you are of, laying the cau≈øe of the late Wars, at the Anabapti≈øts Doors? have they not been as ≈øerviceable to their Power, to free their Country from ≈ølavery, as any, both in Pur≈øe and Per≈øon? were they the cau≈øe of the fir≈øt and ≈øecond War in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the ≈øecond War in <hi>England?</hi> was any of them you call <hi>Anabapti≈øts</hi> in the trea≈øonable Engagement? who of them did joyn to bring in King <hi>Charles</hi> again, into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> fir≈øt, and afterwards into <hi>England?</hi> was it the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øt, or who was it, pray ≈øpeak out, that made all the≈øe Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars both in City and Country?</p>
            <p>But le≈øt you ≈øhould erre for want of Information, let me ≈øhew you, That the Presbyters have been in≈øpired with a wor≈øe Spirit, to carry on their Presbyterian-U≈øurpation, then ever the Anabapti≈øts were in <hi>Germany;</hi> nay, I am ≈øure I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119033:18"/>≈øhould not be ra≈øh, if I ≈øhould ≈øay, The ≈øame Spirit which they have cried down in their Adver≈øaries the Je≈øuites, hath been found breathing in them.</p>
            <p>And for proof hereof, I ≈øhall refer the Reader to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtories and Writings that have been writ by great Patrons of the Presbyterian way. I ≈øhall begin with Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> who in his <hi>Hi≈øtory of the Reformation of the Church of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ≈øaith, That <hi>without the Reformation which they de≈øired, they</hi>(meaning the Covenanters) <hi>would never be ≈øubject to any mortal man.</hi> See <hi>Knox Hi≈øtory of the Church of</hi> Scotland, fir≈øt Impre≈ø≈øion in Octavo, <hi>page</hi> 265.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They,</hi> viz. the Presbyterians, <hi>took away the Queens Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Irons by force and arms, and did ju≈øtifie the ≈øame, Knox</hi> Hi≈øt, <hi>page</hi> 308.</p>
            <p>Again, they ≈øay, <hi>The Commonalty ought to reform Religion, if the King will not.</hi> See <hi>Knox to the Commonalty,</hi> pag. 49, 50. And, That <hi>if Princes be Tyrants again≈øt God and the truth, their Subjects are freed from their Oaths of Allegiance. Knox</hi> to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> fol. 78.</p>
            <p>This they learned from <hi>Geneva:</hi> for when <hi>Farellus Viretus,</hi> and others, fir≈øt preached, the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Geneva</hi> was Lord of the City, and had power as a civil Migi≈øtrate, as <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Letter to Cardinal <hi>Sadolete</hi> writeth, <hi>Jus gladii alias civilis juri≈ødictionis partes,</hi> &amp;c. And yet without any Honour or Re≈øpect, (which they as Chri≈øtians were bound to give him as their civil Magi≈øtrate) they called him a Thief and an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and ≈øo of them≈øelves, with ≈øuch a≈ø≈øi≈øtance as they could get, threw him out of his civil juri≈ødiction: ≈øince which time it hath been a principle among the Presbyters, as appears by <hi>Whittingam</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Book, where he ≈øaith, That <hi>if Kings and Princes refu≈øe to reform Religion, the inferiour Magi≈øtrates or People, by the direction of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery, might lawfully, and ought (if need require) even by force and arms to reform it them≈øelves.</hi> Accordingly they proceeded in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as you have heard out of <hi>Knox,</hi> who was one of the Presbyterian Reformers.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall in the next place, cite ≈øome of <hi>Buchanan</hi> his Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian-Maximes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119033:19"/>out of his Book, entituled, <hi>De Jure Regni,</hi> pag. 61. he ≈øaith, <hi>Populus Rege e≈øt prae≈øtantior &amp; melior:</hi> The People are better then the King, and of greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>Again, he ≈øaith, <hi>Populo jus est, ut imperium cui velit deferat,</hi> pag. 13. <hi>De Jure Regni:</hi> The People have right to be≈øtow the Crown at their plea≈øure.</p>

            <p>Again, <hi>pag.</hi> 58. he ≈øaith, <hi>The people have the ≈øame power over the King, that the King hath over any one per≈øon.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 40. <hi>It were good</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>that rewards were appointed by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for ≈øuch as ≈øhould kill Tyrants, as commonly there is for tho≈øe,</hi> Qui Lupos aut Ur≈øos occiderunt, ant Catulos eorum depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henderunt: <hi>that have killed either Wolves or Bears, or taken their Whelps.</hi>

            <p>This Spirit our old Presbyterians in <hi>England</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired with about the ≈øame time, as the Author of the Book of <hi>Obedience,</hi> (but rather of Rebellion) doth manife≈øt, <hi>page</hi> 215. in the≈øe words, ≈øaying, <hi>If neither the Magi≈øtrate nor the greate≈øt part of the People will do their Offices, in puni≈øhing, depo≈øing or killing of Princes,</hi> (meaning ≈øuch as ≈øhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Presbyterian-Reformation, ≈øo much then ≈øought after by <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>then</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>the Mini≈øter may excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ≈øuch a Prince,</hi> pag. 186.

               <hi>Goodman</hi> (who al≈øo was in that time as great a ≈øtickler for the Presbyterian-Reformation as the re≈øt) ≈øaith in his Book, p. 190. <hi>Subjects do promi≈øe obedience, that the Magi≈øtrate may help them; which if they do not, they are di≈øcharged of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> And in <hi>pag.</hi> 180, 184, 185. he hath many pa≈ø≈øages to the like purpo≈øe; among which, this is ob≈øervable, <hi>The

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Doctrine</hi> (of killing and depo≈øing Magi≈øtrates by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate per≈øon, of the common people, when Magi≈øtrates do not reform according to their humours, ≈øaith <hi>Whittingam</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Goodmans</hi> Book) <hi>was approved by the be≈øt learned in</hi> Geneva; meaning <hi>Calvin</hi> and the re≈øt of the Genevians, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ≈øome Briti≈øh Patrons of that way: for be≈øides <hi>Goodman</hi> and <hi>Whittingam,</hi> there was <hi>Anthony Gibly, Miles Coverdale, David Whitehead,</hi> and ≈øundry others, who did de≈øire that <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Book might be printed, to which <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingam</hi> made a Preface, greatly commending the afore≈øaid bloody Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now whoever ≈øhall compare the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Presbytery ever ≈øince, both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lend,</hi> ≈øhall finde, that they have throughly ≈øtudied this point, <hi>viz.</hi> of imbruing Nations in Blood, and ≈øetting up and throwing down Magi≈øtrates, according as they judge them fit or unfit for their pretended Reformations. Hath not <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to their great grief, found this to be true, by woful experience? And yet the Anabapti≈øts and Fifth-Monarchy-men, are decried by you and Mr. <hi>Willes,</hi> as the onely State-Hereticks and Incendiaries, as though they were the onely men that are again≈øt Magi≈øtracy; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ≈øhall con≈øider of the≈øe forecited pa≈ø≈øages, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there was little rea≈øon why the Presbyterians ≈øhould complain of the Je≈øuites Principles, unle≈øs their own were better: for, if that be true which Dr. <hi>White</hi> ≈øaith is their ≈øpecial vow, which he mentions in <hi>page</hi> 573. of his Reply to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 577. and <hi>pag.</hi> 579. where he ≈øaith, That <hi>the vows of the Je≈øuites are to execute the Popes plea≈øure in killing the King: and what ≈øafety can they have that rely upon ≈øuch Servants?</hi> &amp;c. Which Vow he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerts in Latine in his Margent, out of the Bull of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119033:20"/>of the Je≈øuites, by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third; which is thus much in Engli≈øh: <hi>We judge it expedient for the great Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sea Apo≈øtolike, and more full abnegation of our own Wills and Plea≈øures, that the profe≈ø≈øed of this ≈øociety, be≈øides the common bond of three vows, be further tied by ≈øpecial vow: ≈øo that what≈øoever the Roman Bi≈øhop for the time being ≈øhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand pertinent unto the ≈øalvation of mens ≈øouls, and propagation of the Faith, they ≈øhall be bound to execute the ≈øame pre≈øently, without tergiver≈øation and excu≈øe, whether they ≈øhall be ≈øent unto Turks, or unto Infidels, even unto tho≈øe that are commonly called the Indies, or unto Hereticks or Schi≈ømaticks,</hi> &amp;c. Which Vow, though it be bad enough, and not to be approved, yet it hath not more of a bloody Nature then is contained in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited pa≈ø≈øages out of Presbyterian Authors.</p>
            <p>By this you may ≈øee, that Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> and you had ≈øo little rea≈øon to cry out again≈øt the Anabapti≈øts, for being bloody, and again≈øt Magi≈øtrates, that you and tho≈øe of your way, had need wa≈øh your own hands, before you can with confidence ju≈øtly cry down the Je≈øuites, ≈øince your Principles are as bad as theirs in this particular.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Ly≈øimachus Nicanor,</hi> a Je≈øuite, hath writ a congratulatory Epi≈øtle to the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the yeer 1640. where, in <hi>pag.</hi> 1 he ≈øaith, He <hi>heartily doth congratulate with them, and doth rejoyce at their begun-return to their Mother the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in that they have for≈øaken the erronious Opinion of the Prote≈øtants, concerning the civil Magi≈øtrate, and have happily (in that particular) joyned with the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>And in the ≈øame page he ≈øaith, That <hi>they,</hi> viz, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, <hi>have ≈øo well begun at the Head, the civil Magi≈øtrate, that they tru≈øt they will imbrace the other members of the Roman Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which the Reader may ≈øee that the Presbyters have ≈øought to climbe into their Authority, by the Je≈øuites ≈øteps, though now they cry out again≈øt the ≈øame things: which makes me remember an old ≈øaying, which is verified in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119033:20"/>Presbyters, though it hath been applied to Princes.</p>

            <p>But how do you prove they did not ordain as Bi≈øhops? This is a figment of your own brain: for if they did it as Mini≈øters, why then might not any Mini≈øter have ordained, as well as they? but they never ≈øuffered any ≈øuch thing among them.</p>
            <p>And for your ≈øaying, That <hi>they were lawful Mini≈øters of Chri≈øt, and therefore you do not di≈øtru≈øt his promi≈øe of being with them.</hi>

            <p>Therefore before you go to prove that which I deny not, prove that which is denied, that they are Chri≈øt's Mini≈øters: but if they be your Brethren, the Presbyterians have done very ill to throw them out of their Livings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe their Wives and Children to penury and want, while they enjoy their Places and Revenues. Did ever Chri≈øt's Mini≈øters turn any out of their places, that they judged Chri≈øt's Mini≈øters? or did ever any of them come to take the profits of another's living without his con≈øent which was the incumbent, then they judged the incumbent Chri≈øt's Mini≈øter? and yet the≈øe things have been done without blu≈øhing.

            <p>And the Councel of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ≈øpeaking of the ≈øame <hi>Coluthius,</hi> ≈øaith, That <hi>he died in the</hi> SIMPLE DEGREE OF A PRESBYTER; <hi>and therefore all the impo≈øitions of hands exerci≈øed by him were null; and that all tho≈øe that were ordained by him were but lay Per≈øons; and under that name and title of lay-Per≈øons, they were admitted to the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reckons Ordination by Presbyters as an Arrian Here≈øie, <hi>Her.</hi> 75. in as much as <hi>Arrius</hi> held, That <hi>the Presbyters might ordain as well as Bi≈øhops,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And further he ≈øaith, That <hi>the Epi≈øcopal Order is to beget Fathers to the Church; whereas the Prie≈øtly (or Presbyterian) Order is to beget Children by the Laver of Regeneration: and therefore</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>they</hi> (meaning the Presbyters) <hi>cannot or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119033:22"/>nor beget Fathers and Doctors to the Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augu≈øtin,</hi> Haere≈ø. 53. blames the Arrians for that they had learned of one <hi>Arrius,</hi> to confound the Order of Prie≈øt and Bi≈øhop.</p>
            <p>Is it not plain then, that you endeavour to delude your Reader, by ≈øaying, That <hi>there was no contradiction touching this matter, and that it was the error of one man,</hi> meaning Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor?</hi> when, indeed, your ignorance is very great, if you ≈øay, He was alone in this matter. By this the Reader may ≈øee, That former times did not e≈øteem both Ordinations lawful, <hi>viz</hi> That that was done by Bi≈øhops, and that that was done by Presbyters; but looked upon the one as a meer nullity: ≈øo that whatever you ≈øay, there hath been a manife≈øt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and that the difference was not circum≈øtantial, as you vainly tell your Reader, but e≈ø≈øential: for not onely the Fathers, but Councels, judged Ordination by Presbyters a meer nullity, and that Epi≈øcopal Ordination was e≈ø≈øential to the being of the Mini≈øters Office.</p>
            <p>So that the thing you ≈øo much talk of, <hi>viz.</hi> That both the≈øe Ordinations are of God, is a meer fiction. But more of this anon.</p>

            <p>To which you reply, and the ≈øum of all you ≈øay, is, That <hi>if I have heard Mr.</hi> Willes <hi>in all his Sermons upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I might had under≈øtood, that he was not rigid for Epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, Presbytery, nor Independency; but for a Moderation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that Ordination any of the≈øe ways was good, ≈øeeing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was but in circum≈øtance</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>This is that you call unan≈øwerable.

            <p>To which I an≈øwer, What if that be granted?

            <p>But your ≈øecond Rea≈øon ≈øaith, That <hi>the corruption of the Di≈øpen≈øers, could not make the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion cea≈øe.</hi>

            <p>This An≈øwer will ≈øerve for all the re≈øt of your ≈øimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</p>
            <p>But further, If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was Apo≈øtates and Hereticks, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> had ejected her, and ≈øeparated from her, and judged the Pope to be the great Antichri≈øt, as indeed they did, then it followeth from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, That it is a ≈øin to receive Ordination from them: for the Scripture ≈øaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>If that any refu≈øe to hear the Church, he ≈øhould be e≈øteemed as a heathen and a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, if the Church of <hi>England</hi> did reject <hi>Rome</hi> for her ≈øin and Idolatry, it was then as lawful for me to go to any Fellow under a Hedge, and be ordained by him; as it is to go to any ejected of excommunicated Per≈øons for it: and if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be not cut off from being a Church, then are you very wicked, in that you have not communion with them while they are of the Body; if they are not of the Body, then any of the Body hath as much power to admini≈øter Ordination as they.</p>
            <p>And this is not my ≈øingle Opinion, but it hath been the Opinion of former times: for <hi>Athana≈øius</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>in Epi≈øt. de Conciliis, By what right can any be Bi≈øhops, that do receive their Ordination from Hereticks?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And further, If the Pope be rejected as that great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri≈øt, it cannot be imagined, that he whom all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants judge to be Chri≈øt's greate≈øt Enemy ≈øhould ≈øo far ≈øerve the great de≈øigns of Chri≈øt's Glory, as lawfully to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and impower men to preach Chri≈øt.

               <note place="margin">See his An≈øwer to a counterfeit Catholick, <hi>p.</hi> 50</note> And further, Mr. <hi>Fulk</hi> ≈øaith, That <hi>with all our heart we</hi> (meaning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants) <hi>abhor and dete≈øt all your ≈øtinking grea≈øie Antichri≈øtian Orders.</hi> And yet other of you glory in your ≈øucce≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>See the contradictions among your ≈øelves! who of you ≈øhall a man believe?</p>
            <p>So that if I ≈øay, You cannot have a lawful Ordination from <hi>Rome,</hi> ≈øeeing they were by you judged Hereticks, and ≈øuch as were de≈øervedly excluded; I have the Scripture of my ≈øide that ≈øaith, You ≈øhould e≈øteem ≈øuch as Heathens.

            <p>Your la≈øt Argument you bring to this Point is, That <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtianity was profe≈øt,</hi> and therefore you ask me, <hi>If I will ≈øay there was not a company of true Believers all the time the Pope ruled here,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whence you infer, <hi>If they were true believers, then there was a Church; and if a Church, then there mu≈øt be a Mini≈øtery, becau≈øe</hi> (you ≈øay) <hi>Chri≈øt promi≈øed,</hi> Ephe≈ø.4.11, 12, 13. <hi>That the Saints ≈øhould have ≈øuch a Mini≈øtery till they come to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If this be a good Argument, why do you rail again≈øt the

            <p>By this Rule, Mr. <hi>Brookes</hi> his people are a true Church, and mu≈øt have a true Mini≈øtery, or el≈øe you mu≈øt ≈øay, The people that walk with him are all Unbelievers.</p>

            <p>Upon which you query, <hi>Whether ≈øhe may not be a Cage of every unclean thing, and yet have Gods ≈øacred Ordinances among them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ≈øum of your Que≈øtion, unto which you would give light by ≈øeveral ≈øimilitudes: one is, That <hi>if a Thief have a Bible in his pocket, he is notwith≈øtanding a Thief,</hi> Hence you would infer, <hi>That Rome may be po≈ø≈øe≈øt with Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, though they are Thieves.</hi>

            <p>But have you forgot your ≈øelf? did not you ≈øay, That <hi>the receiver was as bad as the thief?</hi> pag. 21. Now then, if this be true, do you not very craftily call the Clergy Thieves? for they all (you ≈øay) did receive their Ordination from them.</p>
            <p>You further ≈øay, That <hi>the cen≈øers</hi> Corah <hi>burned incen≈øe in, were the Lords,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence you would innfer, That <hi>Ordination is Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though it be in the hands of unholy per≈øons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which I an≈øwer, That the Ordinances are God's, as the Cen≈øers were; but as <hi>Korah</hi> did wickedly in u≈øing them, ≈øo did the Company that partook with him; and it was not their crying out, That <hi>the cen≈øers were holy,</hi> that would excu≈øe them: ≈øo it is not your ≈øaying, That <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mini≈øters is a holy Ordinance,</hi> that will excu≈øe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119033:27"/>in admini≈øtring of it, or you in receiving ≈øuch Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtration.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore this example of <hi>Korah,</hi> and do not you partake of <hi>Korah</hi>'s ≈øin; for though the Cen≈øers were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he had no right to u≈øe them: ≈øee therefore how this ≈øimilitude makes again≈øt you, and fully ≈øhews your vanity, that all you glory in, is but what you have received from a <hi>Korah,</hi> a Thief, a Harlot, which had no more right to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øter it, then a Thief hath to di≈øtribute ≈øtolen Goods.</p>

            <p>You ≈øay nothing in your Counter-Query, but what hath been ≈øaid before; onely you urge a fre≈øh ≈øimilitude that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to your purpo≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>if my Accounts that be in my Book be ju≈øt and right, they ought not to be nulled, becau≈øe my boy hath naughtily written them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence you would infer, That <hi>Ordination is Gods Ordinance, though it hath been defaced by the Church of</hi> Romes <hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which is not any part of my Que≈øtion: for though my Accounts are not to be di≈øowned becau≈øe my boy hath blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, yet my boy hath not power to di≈øpo≈øe of them acording to his invention: neither is it lawful for you, if I ≈øhall declare him to be a Thief, to receive any of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from him, or take any di≈øcharge or acquittance for any debt that you owe me, at his hand. In like manner is it ≈øinful to receive Ordination from <hi>Rome:</hi> if they have turned Thieves and Robbers, as you ≈øay they are , then the Receiver is as bad as the Thief.

            <p>The ≈øub≈øtance of your Counter-Query to this, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to your Succe≈ø≈øion, is an≈øwered already in the thirty

            <p>Fir≈øt, That there was no need of our fir≈øt Reformers pleading nece≈ø≈øity; for they were as idolatrous when they fir≈øt rent from <hi>Rome,</hi> as they were when they were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they had ≈øeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becau≈øe of her uncleanne≈øs, then there was no need for them to plead nece≈ø≈øity for their preaching without Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øince they might have been ordained by the reformed Churches in other Countries, which had for≈øaken <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, if Nece≈ø≈øity may be a Warrant to them at that time, it was as good a Warrant to other Sects that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as it was for tho≈øe you call our fir≈øt Reformers. So that then, if any <hi>Arrians</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. ≈øhould have Rent from <hi>Rome,</hi> and gathered into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, they might have pleaded that they had a lawful Mini≈øtery, either by Succe≈ø≈øion, in that ≈øome of them had been Prie≈øts before they revolted; or el≈øe by vertue of a Nece≈ø≈øity, ≈øince a po≈øitive Law gives place to nece≈ø≈øity.

Thus the Reader may ≈øee, that rather then you would want an arrow to ≈øhoot at M. <hi>Brooks,</hi> you would borrow one out of my quiver; and you do as good as confe≈øs as much, when you conclude, and ≈øay, That <hi>your heart trembleth, and you heartily wi≈øh, that you could not plead ≈øo ≈øtrongly, to ≈øadden hone≈øt hearts, to plea≈øe me, and ≈øuch as I am.</hi> It ≈øeems then, your con≈øcience told you, That you had given away your cau≈øe to the grief of your ≈øelf and others, becau≈øe you could not help it; and therefore <hi>you wi≈øh heartily, that you COULD not plead ≈øo much, to plea≈øe ≈øuch as I am.</hi> So that it ≈øeems, you are now forced to yield to your own grief and others of your friends, which you call <hi>hone≈øt hearts,</hi> &amp;c. it ≈øeems then, the truth is too ≈øtrong for you. But to proceed.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:119033:30"/>
            <p>You come now to make Counter-queries, upon my 42, 43, 44, and 45 Queries that are grounded upon Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his decrying the Fifth-Monarchy-Men, as the ≈ømoak of the bottomle≈øs pit: to this I have already given an≈øwer. And to the Counter-queries you propound upon my 46 que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, touching Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his Di≈øcour≈øe with me in private, I have already an≈øwered in my Reply to M. <hi>Willes</hi> his Letter.</p>
            <p>And for your Counter-query that you make upon my 47 que≈øtion about Mr. <hi>Willes</hi> his per≈øwading a Gentleman to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend me for a Je≈øuite, though you ≈øay, <hi>I am too blame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an information from one man,</hi> &amp;c. Sure you are more too blame to believe the Accu≈øed's bare negation: but for the truth of what I object again≈øt M. <hi>Willes,</hi> viz. That he did de≈øire a Gentleman to apprehend me for a Je≈øuite; I ≈øhall refer the Reader to the Gentleman aforenamed, who is ready to make oath for his further ≈øatisfaction.</p>
            <p>And for your ≈øaying, That <hi>I did live a concealed life about</hi> London <hi>for many yeers; and therefore there might be ≈øome ground for people to ≈øu≈øpect me.</hi> Truely, I think there is more rea≈øon why I ≈øhould ≈øu≈øpect you, who are ≈øo concealed, as that you refu≈øe to let your Name or place of abode be known; I am ≈øure, this I never did upon any occa≈øion in all my life.</p>
            <p>I come now to take notice of your Po≈øt≈øcript, wherein you tell your Reader of ≈øome things you have to adverti≈øe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fir≈øt</hi> (you ≈øay) <hi>is, That it is a great ≈øign of truth, when men of corrupt mindes are enraged again≈øt it.</hi> Truely, then it is a ≈øign that we are in the truth; for men of corrupt mindes are again≈øt us, witne≈øs the rude behavior of tho≈øe that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to throw me over the Gallery for asking M. <hi>Willes</hi> a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion; and not onely tho≈øe, but ≈øuch as make a gain of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, leaping from one benefice to another, where they can get the be≈øt fleece, and mo≈øt profit; and that without they can have their own demands of their Pari≈øh, they will leave them, and go to another. I ≈øay, the≈øe are the men that cry down that which we profe≈øs, as the ≈ømoak of the bottomle≈øs pit, and would have men apprehended as Je≈øuites, or any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119033:31"/>how, ≈øo that they can be revenged upon them for not being of their Opinion: I ≈øay then, That if this may be called a good Argument, the Truth is of our ≈øide: but this is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible way of rea≈øoning. In the ≈øecond place, you tell your Reader, That <hi>tho≈øe that have de≈øigns again≈øt the truth, have u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ≈øome plau≈øible pretence to carry them on,</hi> &amp;c. To this I an≈øwer, That you are none of tho≈øe that have <hi>plau≈øible</hi> de≈øigns again≈øt the truth; though you have a great many, you have ≈øcarce one that is <hi>plau≈øible:</hi> for if you had, you would never have di≈øcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world ≈øo much <hi>contradiction &amp; folly,</hi> as you have <hi>done</hi> in your Book; neither would you have declared, That <hi>your Mother, the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>was a Harlot at the time that your Predece≈ø≈øors received Ordination from her;</hi> neither would you have compared her to <hi>Korah,</hi> &amp; to a Thief, as you have done; and yet ju≈øtifie her ordaining Mini≈øters to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel. Would you have had your de≈øigns <hi>plau≈øible,</hi> you ≈øhould never have di≈øcovered the Pedegree of your Clergy, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Progenitors <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Harlots:</hi> ≈øure this will not be <hi>plau≈øible</hi> to any that ≈øhall hear it, when they come to know, that your glorious ≈øucce≈ø≈øion you ≈øo much boa≈øt of, came from ≈øuch infamous Predece≈ø≈øors. The third thing you inform your Reader in, is, That <hi>tho≈øe that de≈øign the propagating of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, will for the mo≈øt part oppo≈øe, but ≈øeldom a≈ø≈øert,</hi> &amp;c. To this I reply, That this is the rea≈øon you an≈øwered by counter-que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and that rather then you would a≈ø≈øert any thing po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, you put your re≈øpondent to prove negations; when the contrary was found in me: for I offered to a≈ø≈øert and prove again≈øt M. <hi>Willes,</hi> and he refu≈øed it. The la≈øt thing you inform your Reader, is, That <hi>this Book is your fir≈øt,</hi> &amp;c. This you u≈øe as an argument why he ≈øhould excu≈øe your mi≈øtakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and truely, Sir, you had need of a pardon: and if you did not <hi>hope</hi> for it, you might <hi>fear</hi> to be corrected by a more ≈øevere hand then mine, for tho≈øe many <hi>impertinencies, ≈ølanders</hi> and <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> that your Book is fraught withal; which I pray God help you to con≈øider of, that you may do nothing again≈øt the truth, but for it; which is the de≈øire of,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have for thy further ≈øatisfaction publi≈øhed ≈øome Ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that I have collected, touching the Ordination of the National Mini≈øtery, ≈øince their revolt from <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt, it is ob≈øervable, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. did not ≈øeparate from <hi>Rome</hi> for con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but for ba≈øe ends, and for filthy lucre ≈øake, as appears by their retaining all the ≈øuper≈øtitious cu≈øtoms of the Roman Church, and their per≈øecuting to death tho≈øe that did out of a good con≈øcience oppo≈øe them. The truth hereof is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully manife≈øted in the Hi≈øtories of that time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the beginning of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. his Reign, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervable, that the whole frame of Religion was altered, and ≈øuch a Reformation begun, as did agree with the wills of a Committee of twelve Men; and what form of wor≈øhip ≈øhould be agreed upon by any ≈øeven of the≈øe, was to be ob≈øerved by the whole Nation. This was ≈øuch great pre≈øumption, that the like cannot be parallel'd in any Eccle≈øia≈øtical ≈øtory; and yet now the Anabapti≈øts are cried down, as Men full of pre≈øumption, and ≈øuch as ≈øwerve from the ≈øteps of Tradition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is ob≈øervable, That in the time of Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the Roman Religion was by her re≈øtored, and the Land was over-≈øpread with Popery; and Popi≈øh Bi≈øhops and Prie≈øts were ≈øet up in all parts of this Realm, and their Religion confirmed by Act of Parliament: and Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> the Pope's Legite, ab≈øolved the Kingdom from the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which the Pope had pronounced again≈øt the Land.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is ob≈øervable, That when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began to Reign, the whole Nation being over-≈øpread with Popery; in≈øomuch, that all Bi≈øhops that would not take the Oath of Supremacy, were turned out of their Bi≈øhopricks; ≈øo that by this means, there was a want of Bi≈øhops to ≈øupply
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119033:32"/>the places of tho≈øe which the Queen had ejected for Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: ≈øo that from that time to this, our Clergy have been at a lo≈øs, touching their Ordination, as appears,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe they ≈øometimes plead an Ordination by ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion; and ≈øometimes, they leave ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, and plead to nece≈ø≈øity, and an extraordinary Call.</p>
            <p>Now, if they plead they have their Ordination by ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion from <hi>Rome,</hi> then they mu≈øt ju≈øtifie <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church of Chri≈øt; and ≈øo are guilty of Schi≈øm, in renting, ≈øince they ≈øay, <hi>She was as good when they left her, as ≈øhe was when they were ordained by her.</hi> Again, if that <hi>Rome</hi> was not a Church of Chri≈øt when they were ordained by her, then they are at a lo≈øs on the other hand, becau≈øe that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove a power of ordaining Mini≈øters, given to any out of the Church So that if their Ordination from <hi>Rome</hi> by ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion be valued, <hi>Rome</hi> mu≈øt be ju≈øtified to be a true Church.</p>
            <p>Again, if they ≈øhall plead to nece≈ø≈øity and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Call, here they are at a lo≈øs again; becau≈øe, fir≈øt there were many reformed Churches in the World, from whom they might have been ordained, without receiving Orders from <hi>Rome:</hi> and al≈øo, they had no rea≈øon to plead nece≈ø≈øity of Preaching without Ordination, ≈øince they might have had it from tho≈øe Churches that were reformed before them. La≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they fear to plead this Argument of nece≈ø≈øity, le≈øt they ≈øhould ju≈øtifie their Adver≈øaries the Anabapti≈øts, and other Sectaries, which have more rea≈øon to plead nece≈ø≈øity then them≈øelves. This appears by M. <hi>Willes</hi> his refu≈øal to re≈øolve me, when I was at his Hou≈øe, Whether he was a Mini≈øter by a lawful ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, or nece≈ø≈øity, becau≈øe he knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was a Je≈øuite or an Anabapti≈øt: for it is u≈øual for them to plead their Ordination by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, when they would oppo≈øe the Anabapti≈øts, and to take up the Anabapti≈øts Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of nece≈ø≈øity when they oppo≈øe the Papi≈øts: and therefore Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> and <hi>Whittingam,</hi> and divers others when they have had to do with Papi≈øts, have inveighed again≈øt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from them, as a ≈øtinking filthy thing, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ob≈øerved. So that the great lo≈øs they are at among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119033:32"/>touching the Derivation of their Authority, is one Rea≈øon why it may be que≈øtioned, Whether they have any or no?</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond Rea≈øon is their unwillingne≈øs to an≈øwer tho≈øe Objections, that their Adver≈øaries the Papi≈øts, objected again≈øt their Ordination; which is a ≈øhrewd ≈øign, they feared it would not abide the trial.</p>
            <p>As, 1. they objected, That <hi>the Engli≈øh Reformers in Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s time, went to a Popi≈øh Iri≈øh Bi≈øhop that was then Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner in the</hi> Tower, <hi>and promi≈øed him his liberty and a ≈øum of money, if he would ordain them Bi≈øhops; but he refu≈øed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is objected by their Adver≈øaries the Papi≈øts, That <hi>they ≈øought to be ordained by the Bi≈øhop of</hi> Landaff <hi>but he refu≈øed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is further objected, That <hi>Parker, and others of the Queens new Bi≈øhops, were ordained by one</hi> Scory <hi>a Priest, at a meeting which they had for this purpo≈øe, at the Nags-head-Tavern in</hi> Cheap-≈øide.</p>
            <p>To the≈øe Objections no An≈øwer was given till Bi≈øhop <hi>Ma≈øons</hi> time, which was nigh fifty yeers after when mo≈øt of the men were dead that were the chief Witne≈ø≈øes to the≈øe things, though the An≈øwer at that time much concerned them, the≈øe Objections being then the common talk of their Adver≈øaries.</p>
            <p>A third Rea≈øon, why they are to be que≈øtioned, appears in the Ca≈øe of the new-made Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winche≈øter,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted Bi≈øhop <hi>Bonner;</hi> to which <hi>Bonner</hi> pleaded, That <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che≈øter was no Bi≈øhop according to any Law;</hi> and the Judges in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time did re≈øolve, That <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Plea ≈øhould be received: See the <hi>Abridgement of</hi> Diers <hi>Reports,</hi> 7 Eliz. 234. And that they were at this time no Bi≈øhops, neither by Statute-Law or Canon-Law, appears by the great indu≈øtry and care that the new Bi≈øhops took to get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves confirmed by Act of Parliament; the words of the Act are the≈øe, <hi>All Acts and things heretofore made and done, about the con≈øecration of Archbi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, Prie≈øts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by vertue of the Queens Letters Patents, ≈øince the begining of her Reign, be and ≈øhall be, by Authority of this Parliament, declared
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119033:33"/>and judged good and perfect,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after in the ≈øame Act it followeth, That <hi>all Archbi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, Prie≈øts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be declared in very deed, by the Authority afore≈øaid, and enacted to be Archbi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops, Prie≈øts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and rightly made, ordered and con≈øecrated: any Statute-Law, Canon-Law, or other thing to the contrary notwith≈øtanding,</hi> 8 Eliz. 1. So that you may ≈øee that the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> were no lawful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Mini≈øters, neither by Statute nor Canon-Law, till the 8 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Opinion of the Judges in the Ca≈øe of <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi> before mentioned: which I de≈øire may be con≈øidered by all judicious Chri≈øtians; and then I que≈øtion not but they will ≈øee, that the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to glory in their Apo≈øtolical ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, and to cry down others that ≈øtand upon a more religious foot of account then them≈øelves.</p>
